# Photo search engine app

---

A simple application for searching images by keyword using the Pixabay API

## Introduction

---

The search engine allows you to search for photos from the Pixabay API database
using a keyword. I used react-loader-spinner in the shape of three hearts. It
appears when you search for more images. After pressing the selected image, a
large modal window with the selected photo appears. You can close it by pressing
the esc key on your keyboard or using your mouse outside the image.
